Render 3D geometry in terminal in ASCII chars

- Currently, only a spinning cube.
- Will eventually add more base 3D shapes as well as ability to read and render 3D models using obj files

** NOTE **
Currently only works with gnome terminal. Will be adding compatibility for other terminal emulators.
